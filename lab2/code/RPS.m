function [edges]=RPS(vertices)
%1. Give signs for every vertex
%2. Get the angles from all vertices to start point (compare to Horizontal
%line segment) 
%3. check intersections based on the order

sign = 1 : size(vertices,1);
for cur = 1 : size(vertices,1)% Current vertex index
    for i = cur : size(vertices,1) % Get the angles from current vertex to other vertices
